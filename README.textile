h2. InstantLoot

Simple World of Warcraft Addon to enable instant looting when AutoLoot is enabled

The idea for this came from other addons like Faster Loot but because of their slow development updates I decided to manage it!

h2. Features

When AutoLoot is enabled through the Blizzard Default UI, upon looting the loot window will not be visible in most cases. 

Great for farming etc.
